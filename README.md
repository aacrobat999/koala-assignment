Known Issues:

- Performance may degrade on very large trees due to recursive rendering.

- Unique IDs are generated on each load, causing unnecessary re-renders if data changes.

- Styling is basic and may not scale well for deep hierarchies.

- No confirmation on node removal, which could lead to accidental deletions.

Future Features / Improvements:

- Stable unique IDs and improved state management for nodes.

- Virtualized rendering for large trees to improve performance.

- Better tree connectors and dynamic styling for deep hierarchies.

- Keyboard navigation.

- Node editing, bulk actions, and undo functionality.

- Search, filter, and sort functionality for tree data.

- Smooth expand/collapse animations and more user-friendly UX.
